                    <h3>IT STARTED, QUITE SIMPLY, LIKE THIS...</h3>
                    <p>Our steak house name, IL CORDA means “the rope” in Italian. Warm, heartfelt watchfulness, care,
                        and service in the Japanese style. Cuisine that makes most of the ingredients’ natural flavors,
                        centered around our charcoal grilled steak
                    </p>

                    <p>Here in our steak house located in Ho Chi Minh, we have terrace seating, private rooms,
                        and seats at the counter, we have a range of areas adapted to the styles and needs of our many
                        customers.
                    </p>

                    <p>Our steak house’s three “ropes” – people,
                        food, and atmosphere – are treated with the utmost importance by all our staff,
                        and we hope to combine them into one strong, thick “rope”.
                    </p>
